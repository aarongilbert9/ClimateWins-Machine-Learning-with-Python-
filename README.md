# ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-with-Python-
# Objective
In response to the sharp rise in extreme weather events over the past two decades, ClimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.
# Introduction
Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. Itâ€™s been sorting through hurricane predictions from The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S., typhoon data from The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Japan, world temperatures, and a great deal of other data.
# Data Sets
* Data set is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022.
* Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more.
* This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
# Hypotheses
1.  MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT FUTURE WEATHER CONDITIONS.
2. PREDICTION ACCURACY WILL VARY BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND VARIOUS CLIMATE CONDITIONS WITHIN THE REGION.
3. MACHINE LEARNING CAN IDENTIFY SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS ADVERSE EFFECTS.
